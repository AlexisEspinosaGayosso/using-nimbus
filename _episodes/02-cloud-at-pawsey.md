Cloud computing has as many applications as there are algorithms (ie: lots).  However at Pawsey Supercomputing Centre we are tasked with supporting researchers in Australia solve complex problems with computational facilities. Using Nimbus can help you scale your problems and make them solvable in a reasonable timeframe.  Is it "Supercomputing"?  We generally reserve such terms to describe our peak computing facilities.  At Pawsey our peak computer is Magnus, a 36000 core Cray XC-30.  It is intended for very large, parallelized workflows that have been specifically designed to run optimally on such hardware.
